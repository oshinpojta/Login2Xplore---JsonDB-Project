# *Login2Xplore---JsonDB-Project*
A small project to demonstrate the new technology - JsonDB.

### Warning ! ## 
*Since the api uses Http-connection (and not Https) and all the webhosting servers only allow Https connections.
So, This site faces the issue of sending and retrieving data. Although the illustrations are provided for complete process.
But still if anyone wants to check this beautifully constructed page, Welcome !*
